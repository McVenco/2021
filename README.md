## Art and creativity
This year my goal is to hone and expand my creative skills. I have followed a course on creative writing, and a general creativity course on Instagram, and my ultimate goal is to start selling some of my work.

### Achievements and goals:
Create AT LEAST one work per week - f.i. a drawing, painting, a bit of writing.
I will post some of it on Instagram: www.instagram.com/klunstigheden (mostly in Dutch)
